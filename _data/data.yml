        Internship at the SAP Labs Latin America Innovation Team focused on solving problems with freedom of technology choice. Here I helped creating Leap and many other solo minor projects that helped me being more autonomous and broader my technology pool to be able to solve different kinds of problems. I'm also responsible for the DevOps and infrastructure of the team, taking care of all our Azure pipelines and BTP sub-accounts. Furthermore, I engaged with the SAP developer community by giving trainings and organizing events.

#   title: Self-evaluation
#   description: |
#     The self-evaluation section in a resume is a section where you can evaluate and assess your own skills, strengths, and weaknesses. It is typically a short paragraph or bullet points at the end of your resume, which provides a personal perspective on your abilities and how they align with the requirements of the job.

#     In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

#     A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow. However, it is important to be honest and avoid over-inflating your skills or qualifications, as this can negatively impact your credibility and the hiring manager's impression of you.
